You are working for Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company. Bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic has flexible pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred 
to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships as finance analysts have concluded that annual 
memberships are much more profitable than casual riders. She also believes that there is a good chance of converting casual riders to members as they are already 
aware of Cyclistic program and have chosen it for their mobility needs.


Business Task-

To analyze user behaviours on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently to make 
recommendations on how to convert casual riders into annual members.
